### MUMT 307 Project

Implementing digital audio synthesis and effects on the Sparkfun redboard/Arduino uno.

*Click the wiki link on the side for more details ->* 

Video of tests 1 through 5:
1. low A tone
2. mid A tone
3. additive synthesis of 1 and 2
4. square wave with three components
5. envelope test
6. delay line
7. plucked string

*What currently works:*
* All connections and soldering; audio sounds smooth.
* Single sine waves
* Additive synthesis of sine waves
* Amplitude envelopes (voltage on the board)
* Additive synthesis of squareish waves (can also play all separately)
