### MUMT 307 Project

Implementing digital audio synthesis and effects on the Sparkfun redboard/Arduino uno.

*What currently works:*
* All connections and soldering; audio sounds smooth.
* Single sine waves
* Additive synthesis of sine waves
* Amplitude envelopes (voltage on the board)
* Additive synthesis of squareish waves (can also play all separately)
