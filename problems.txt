- Had to figure out the differences between the newer and older version of the Redboard - the newer one has a few extra pins. I didn't use these but they're interesting to read about. 

- The drivers necessary for the Arduino IDE to work would not load correctly on my system (Ubuntu 14.04) so I switched to a browser-based IDE, codebender.cc. The error message was about COM1 serial port.
